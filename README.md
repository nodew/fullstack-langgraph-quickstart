# Fullstack LangGraph Quickstart - Multi-Provider Edition

**üöÄ Enhanced fork of [gemini-general-llm-providers](https://github.com/original-repo/gemini-general-llm-providers) with expanded LLM provider support**

This project demonstrates a fullstack application using a React frontend and a LangGraph-powered backend agent. Originally designed for Google's Gemini models, this fork has been enhanced to support **multiple LLM providers** including OpenAI, Anthropic Claude, Ollama, and Azure OpenAI. The agent performs comprehensive research on user queries by dynamically generating search terms, querying the web, reflecting on results to identify knowledge gaps, and iteratively refining searches until it can provide well-supported answers with citations.

**Key Enhancement:** While the original project was limited to Gemini models, this fork enables you to use any combination of supported LLM providers for different stages of the research process, providing flexibility in cost optimization and performance tuning.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into two main directories:

-   `frontend/`: Contains the React application built with Vite.
-   `backend/`: Contains the LangGraph/FastAPI application, including the research agent logic.

## Getting Started: Development and Local Testing

Follow these steps to get the application running locally for development and testing.

**1. Prerequisites:**

-   Node.js and npm (or yarn/pnpm)
-   Python 3.8+
-   **API Keys**: At least one LLM provider API key is required. Choose from:
    - **`GEMINI_API_KEY`** (recommended for web search functionality)
    - **`OPENAI_API_KEY`** for OpenAI models
    - **`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`** for Claude models
    - **`OLLAMA_BASE_URL`** for Ollama models
    - **Azure OpenAI** credentials (see Multi-Provider Support section)

    1.  Navigate to the `backend/` directory.
    2.  Create a file named `.env` by copying the `backend/.env.example` file.
    3.  Open the `.env` file and add your API key(s). For example: `GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_ACTUAL_API_KEY"`

**2. Install Dependencies:**

**Backend:**

```bash
cd backend
uv venv
uv sync
# OR
uv pip install -e .
```

**Frontend:**

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

**3. Run Development Servers:**

**Backend & Frontend:**

```bash
make dev
```
This will run the backend and frontend development servers.    Open your browser and navigate to the frontend development server URL (e.g., `http://localhost:5173/app`).

_Alternatively, you can run the backend and frontend development servers separately. For the backend, open a terminal in the `backend/` directory and run `langgraph dev`. The backend API will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:2024`. It will also open a browser window to the LangGraph UI. For the frontend, open a terminal in the `frontend/` directory and run `npm run dev`. The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:5173`._

## Multi-Provider Support

This application now supports multiple LLM providers for enhanced flexibility and cost optimization:

### Supported Providers
- **Google Gemini** (default): `gemini-2.0-flash`, `gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17`, `gemini-2.5-pro-preview-05-06`
- **OpenAI**: `gpt-4o`, `gpt-4o-mini`, `gpt-3.5-turbo`
- **Azure OpenAI**: `gpt-4o`, `gpt-4o-mini`, `gpt-35-turbo` (using your Azure deployments)
- **Anthropic Claude**: `claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022`, `claude-3-5-haiku-20241022`
- **Ollama**: `llama3.1:8b`

To add more models, you can update the [models.py](./backend/src/agent/models.py). And please be aware, the model you added should support `structured output`.

### Configuration
Add API keys to your `.env` file:
```env
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_key            # Optional
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key            # Optional
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_claude_key         # Optional
OLLAMA_BASE_URL=http://localhost:11434    # Optional
# Azure OpenAI (Optional)
AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=https://your-resource-name.openai.azure.com/
AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_azure_openai_key
AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION=2024-02-01
```

## How the Backend Agent Works (High-Level)

The core of the backend is a LangGraph agent defined in `backend/src/agent/graph.py`. It follows these steps:

![Agent Flow](./agent.png)

1.  **Generate Initial Queries:** Based on your input, it generates a set of initial search queries using a Gemini model.
2.  **Web Research:** For each query, it uses the Gemini model with the Google Search API to find relevant web pages.
3.  **Reflection & Knowledge Gap Analysis:** The agent analyzes the search results to determine if the information is sufficient or if there are knowledge gaps. It uses a Gemini model for this reflection process.
4.  **Iterative Refinement:** If gaps are found or the information is insufficient, it generates follow-up queries and repeats the web research and reflection steps (up to a configured maximum number of loops).
5.  **Finalize Answer:** Once the research is deemed sufficient, the agent synthesizes the gathered information into a coherent answer, including citations from the web sources, using a Gemini model.

## Deployment

In production, the backend server serves the optimized static frontend build. LangGraph requires a Redis instance and a Postgres database. Redis is used as a pub-sub broker to enable streaming real time output from background runs. Postgres is used to store assistants, threads, runs, persist thread state and long term memory, and to manage the state of the background task queue with 'exactly once' semantics. For more details on how to deploy the backend server, take a look at the [LangGraph Documentation](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/deployment_options/). Below is an example of how to build a Docker image that includes the optimized frontend build and the backend server and run it via `docker-compose`.

_Note: For the docker-compose.yml example you need a LangSmith API key, you can get one from [LangSmith](https://smith.langchain.com/settings)._

_Note: If you are not running the docker-compose.yml example or exposing the backend server to the public internet, you update the `apiUrl` in the `frontend/src/App.tsx` file your host. Currently the `apiUrl` is set to `http://localhost:8123` for docker-compose or `http://localhost:2024` for development._

**1. Build the Docker Image:**

   Run the following command from the **project root directory**:
   ```bash
   docker build -t gemini-fullstack-langgraph -f Dockerfile .
   ```
**2. Run the Production Server:**

   ```bash
   GEMINI_API_KEY=<your_gemini_api_key> LANGSMITH_API_KEY=<your_langsmith_api_key> docker-compose up
   ```

Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8123/app/` to see the application. The API will be available at `http://localhost:8123`.
